# Data Storage & Analysis with Hadoop – CIS 4345

This repository contains the projects and assignments I completed for **CIS 4345 – Data Storage & Analysis with Hadoop**.

In this course, I learned how to store, manage, and process large datasets using Hadoop’s ecosystem, mainly focusing on HDFS and MapReduce programming.

### 🗃️ Topics Covered

- HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) setup and usage
- Writing custom **MapReduce** programs
- Working with big datasets in distributed environments
- Understanding how Hadoop handles data at scale
- Data storage concepts and batch processing

### ⚙️ Tools Used

- **Apache Hadoop**
- **Java** (for MapReduce programs)
- Linux/Command Line for file handling and HDFS operations

### 💡 Why This Matters

Hadoop is a foundation of big data systems. These projects helped me understand how distributed file systems and data processing work behind the scenes—especially useful for working with large-scale or enterprise-level data.
